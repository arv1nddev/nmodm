# NMODM 

**NMODM** is a turn-based, two-player strategy game where logic—not luck—decides the winner.

Players start from a number and take turns adding values from a fixed range.  
The first to reach the target number **wins**.

##  Rules

- Each turn, add **1 → (m − 1)**

- **Standard** – `k = 0`, range `1–9`, `t = 100`
